## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **`proef test --output tap`** — a TAP version 13 stream to stdout, one test
  point per scenario, derived from the run's own outcomes (not from hurl), for
  `prove`/`tappy` and TAP-native CI. The human report moves to stderr (as with
  `--output json`). `@quarantine` scenarios map to the `# TODO` directive
  (their failure does not gate); skipped scenarios to `# SKIP`; failure detail
  rides in a redacted YAML block. `--output tap` is rejected on `flows`/`macros`
  (a user error, not a silent human fall-back).
- `proef macros` now flags **near-duplicate** pattern macros — two that differ
  only in their `{capture}` names (identical literal skeleton), which are
  confusable to authors. Advisory only (never gates the exit code); `--output
  json` gains a `nearDuplicateOf` field beside `unused` for a CI hygiene check.
  The heuristic is deliberately tight (skeleton equality), so a legitimately
  similar family with distinct literals is left alone.
- Localized Gherkin (`# language:`) is now verified and test-covered — a
  localized feature parses, its dialect keywords are stripped, and a localized
  scenario outline with `Examples` expands like any other. Outline detection now
  keys primarily on `Examples` presence (dialect-independent) with the English
  keyword as a fallback, so this no longer relies on an English-only heuristic.
  (A localized outline that omits its `Examples` still degrades to an
  unbound-step error, since gherkin 0.16 does not expose its dialect keywords.)
- **Built-in `expect:` shape-macro library.** The embedded `Core` pack gains a
  curated, product-neutral set of response-shape assertions — `the value at
  {path} is a string` / `… a number` / `… a boolean` / `… a uuid` / `… an ISO
  date` / `… present` / `… a non-empty list` — each merging one hurl type
  predicate (`isString`/`isUuid`/`isList` + `count`, …) into the previous
  request. It is a convenience layer over the existing `expect:` mechanism (no
  new engine capability, no marker DSL); the raw-hurl assert vocabulary still
  covers anything the macros don't.
- **Run-level SLA gate (`proef.toml [sla]`).** An opt-in latency budget: after a
  run, per-step wall-clock durations fold into `p95-ms` (95th-percentile ceiling)
  and `max-ms` (slowest-step ceiling); a breach prints the offending metrics + the
  slowest steps and maps to **exit 1** (a test failure). It is off by default (no
  `[sla]` table = no gate, run byte-identical to before), env-overridable via
  `[env.<name>.sla]`, introduces no new exit code, and never downgrades a
  `User`/`System` fault. Distinct from hurl's per-request `duration <` assert —
  the gate is an aggregate budget over the whole run. Skipped steps are excluded
  from the population.

- **External config & environments (`proef.toml`, ADR-0012).** New `[url]` and
  `[vars]` tables hold non-secret suite variables, referenced in packs as
  `${url:<key>}` / `${vars:<key>}`; `[env.<name>.<section>]` profiles deep-merge
  per-environment overrides over the base tables (`url`/`vars`/`http`/`run`).
  `proef test --env <name>` (or `PROEF_ENV`) selects the active environment.
  `proef.toml` is discovered by searching up from the working directory (like
  cargo/git), so it is found from any subdirectory. Adds the
  `proef::resolve::missing_config_var` diagnostic.
- **Default suite path.** `[run] suite` sets the path `proef test`/`flows`/
  `artifacts` use when given none (falling back to the `tests/` convention), so
  `proef test` runs with no argument. An explicit path still wins.
- Documentation set completing the corpus: `docs/DIAGNOSTICS.md` (all 57
  diagnostic codes, corpus coverage marked), `docs/CONFIG.md` (`proef.toml`
  reference), `docs/EVENTS.md` (the `events.jsonl` wire schema for CI),
  `docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md` (exit codes, glyph legend, frequent failures),
  `docs/CONTRIBUTING.md` and `docs/SECURITY.md` (threat model, private
  vulnerability reporting), and an IDE-integration section in AUTHORING.
- `proef test --scenario-file <file>`: scope a `--scenario` name filter to
  one feature file (duplicate scenario names across files stay disjoint;
  the libtest-mimic harness uses it to keep the Trial↔scenario bijection).
- `scenario_finished` events now carry a `file` field — the run-wide scenario
  identity alongside `scenario` (additive, ADR-0008; absent in older records).
- Diagnostics `pack::pattern_duplicate_capture` (a `{capture}` written twice)
  and `lower::kind_unrouted` (internal registry-drift safety net).
- `proef macros` lists every loaded macro with its call count and flags
  user-pack pattern macros that no scenario binds (dead prose bindings);
  `use:`-only helpers and unused builtins are listed but never flagged.
  `--output json` for CI dead-code gates.
- `proef test --run-id <id>` pins the injected run id (like `artifacts --run-id`),
  so a run's `${fake:…}` data — which keys on the run id — is reproducible; the
  JSON summary echoes the id.
- `proef test --dry-run --sarif <path>` serializes validation diagnostics
  (unbound steps, pack lint, non-finite retries) to a SARIF 2.1.0 log — a
  shift-left gate that renders findings as inline PR annotations. The export is
  additive: the dry-run's exit code is unchanged.
- `proef test --rerun` re-runs only the scenarios that failed in the last run
  (read from its JSONL record, keyed on the run-wide `(file, name)` identity);
  it composes with `--tags`/`--scenario`, and reports "nothing to rerun"
  (exit 0) when the prior run was clean.
- `@quarantine` tag: a scenario so tagged runs and reports normally, but its
  *test-failure* no longer gates the exit code (a `System`/`User` fault still
  does — quarantine is for flaky tests, not broken input or infra). A note
  prints when a quarantined scenario fails, so it is never silently swallowed.
- `proef diff [base] [new]` compares two run records (defaulting to the previous
  and latest runs) and reports scenario status transitions — regressed, fixed,
  still-failing, new, removed — keyed on the run-wide `(file, scenario)`
  identity, plus per-step flakiness (rising retry counts) and perf deltas
  (steps diffed on `text`, never the volatile authored line). It is a derived
  view over `events.jsonl`, never a second record (ADR-0008); `--fail-on-regression`
  exits 1 when a scenario regressed, for CI gating.
- Flaky-failure detail: a step that passes only after a retry now records the
  messages from its earlier, failed attempts as `attempt_details` on the
  `step_finished` event (additive, ADR-0008); JUnit surfaces them as
  `<flakyFailure>` under the passing test case, so a green-on-retry run is honest
  instead of indistinguishable from a clean pass. The engine already collected
  the earlier-attempt errors — they were being discarded on success.
- `proef report [run-id]` writes a self-contained HTML report for a run —
  scenario tree with pass/fail pills, per-step attempts and timing, a
  per-scenario timing waterfall (each step's bar offset by the steps before it
  and as wide as its own duration — the sequential cascade within a scenario,
  derived purely from step durations), a **cross-worker timeline** (a lane per
  worker, each scenario a bar on a shared run-relative axis, so concurrency is
  visible at a glance), failure detail, and deep-links to the executed `.hurl`
  artifacts (bodies are not inlined).
- **Injected run timing (ADR-0015).** `scenario_started`/`scenario_finished`
  events gain optional `timestamp_ms` (run-relative) and `worker` (0-based
  index) fields, stamped at the CLI sink on the worker thread so the sans-IO
  core stays clock-free. Additive (absent on records without timing); they power
  the HTML timeline. Records without them degrade to the waterfalls alone. A pure `proef_core::html::render_html` derives it from the event
  stream (ADR-0008, snapshot-locked); the events are already redacted at the
  sink, so the page is too. Defaults to `report.html` inside the run dir; `-o`
  redirects it.

### Changed

- **`--tags` is now a boolean expression, not a comma-separated list.** It takes
  a single expression over `and`/`or`/`not` and parentheses (the `@` stays
  optional), e.g. `--tags "@api and not @slow"`; a bare tag still works. The
  grammar and evaluator live in the sans-IO core (`proef_core::tags`,
  deterministic and fuzzed); a malformed expression is a user error (exit 2), as
  is a selection that matches nothing. This replaces the old CSV OR-list — there
  is one selection mechanism, not two.
- `--output` is a typed value: an unknown format (e.g. a `jsonl` typo) is a
  user error (exit 2) instead of silently degrading to the human report.
- `--watch` reruns only on `.feature`/`.yaml`/`.yml` changes — the watched
  tree can now contain proef's own run output without a self-trigger loop.
- The example corpus (`tests/features/`) and the dev fixture use a neutral
  workspace / activity-board domain (record · note · event · attachment ·
  session · channel) — no product-specific vocabulary.
- `CHANGELOG.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, and `SECURITY.md` moved under `docs/`
  (root keeps only `README.md` and `CLAUDE.md`).
- **Pack root key renamed `templates:` → `macros:`** (ADR-0004 amendment): one
  canonical spelling for the prose→engine binding layer (the entry is a *macro*,
  the file a *pack*). No `templates:` alias — packs using the old key fail to load.
- The dev-loop fixture (`cargo run -p xtask -- fixture`) binds the advertised
  default port **8787** — falling back to an ephemeral port (and printing a
  `PROEF_BASE_URL` line) only if 8787 is busy; `... -- fixture <port>` overrides.
  So `proef.toml`'s default `base` reaches it with no `PROEF_BASE_URL` export
  (ADR-0011 amendment). Its `GET /health` now returns a versioned identity —
  `name`, a numeric `version` (`1.0`), and the RFC 3339 `time` it answered.
- The unbound-step diagnostic (`bind::unbound_step`) now prints a paste-ready
  pack-macro stub — quoted tokens in the sentence become `{argN}` captures —
  alongside the existing did-you-mean suggestion, so an author can add the
  missing macro without hand-writing the `match:`/`hurl:` scaffold.
- CI reporting surfaces failures and flakiness more honestly. Under GitHub
  Actions the run emits a `::error file=,line=,title=` annotation per failure
  (rendered in the PR "Files changed" gutter; gated off when `--output json`
  owns stdout). The job summary gains a **flaky passes** section and per-failure
  attempt counts, and the JUnit report records "passed on attempt N" for a
  scenario that only went green after retries — a silent green-on-attempt-2 is
  no longer invisible.
- `docs/AUTHORING.md` gains an "Asserting responses" cookbook surfacing the hurl
  8.0 predicate/filter/RFC-9535-JSONPath vocabulary that raw `hurl:` blocks
  already accept — documenting existing capability, not new engine work.
- A failed step now prints a `curl:` reproduce line — the redacted `curl` for the
  failing request, surfaced from the embedded engine via a new engine-agnostic
  `StepOutcome.reproduce_hint` — so a failure can be replayed request-by-request
  without leaving the terminal. Secrets are masked.

### Removed

- **The `# key: value` feature-file directive mechanism** (e.g. `# baseURL:`,
  ADR-0012 amendment). Variables now have exactly one home — `proef.toml`
  (`[url]`/`[vars]`) — so a `.feature` file can no longer define a variable
  (one-way-to-do-one-thing). `#` comment lines stay valid gherkin comments; they
  are simply no longer parsed. The env-override the directive provided is
  preserved by embedding `${env:NAME:-default}` in a config value (resolved
  recursively). `${…}` plain-name resolution is now `args > defaults` only.

### Fixed

- Optional-batch error path no longer double-reports later batches into the
  JSONL run record (ADR-0008); `saveAs: global` promotions are no longer
  dropped when the store lock is poisoned; the event sink recovers from a
  poisoned lock instead of truncating the record.
- `expect:` merge scopes to the last entry (fence-aware); `[Options]`
  injection can no longer duplicate a section; the `use:` graph walk is
  node-linear instead of exponential on multi-edge chains.
- The embedded-hurl version lockstep is now asserted by a test; the encrypted
  secret store maps user vs. environment faults to exit 2 vs. 3 (ADR-0009);
  run.log / artifact-write / malformed-`proef.toml` failures surface instead
  of being swallowed.

## [0.3.1] - 2026-07-29 (secret-management hardening)

### Added

- `proef secret rm NAME` removes a stored secret (locked atomic rewrite;
  removing an absent name exits 2).
- `PROEF_KEY` env override supplies the project key directly (base64) — a
  committed ciphertext store now decrypts in CI without shipping the key
  file; a set-but-invalid key errors instead of silently falling through.
- `proef doctor` reports secret store/key health (readable, parseable,
  private permissions); a corrupt `.proef-secrets.json` no longer bricks
  `secret set` — it is moved aside to `.corrupt` and a fresh store begins.

### Fixed

- **Secret-valued captures never reach `.proef-state.json`**: a
  `saveAs: global` capture whose value equals a known secret is refused —
  the owning step warns with the reason — closing the one sink the
  redaction invariant (ADR-0005) did not cover.
- Secret resolution reads the store and key once per run instead of once
  per secret (no torn view against a concurrent `secret set`).
- Warned steps now print their reason on the console (`↳ …`) — a bare ⚠
  glyph explained nothing, for `optional:` failures too.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-07-29 (data-safety blockers, Then visibility, taxonomy)

### Fixed (v0.2.1 review — every finding reproduced before fixing)

- **Asset copy destroyed user files**: `proef artifacts -o` pointing at the
  suite truncated referenced assets to 0 bytes, and `..` references escaped
  the output directory. Copies now refuse absolute/`..` references (exit 2),
  never copy a file onto itself, and surface IO errors (exit 3).
- **Run rotation deleted arbitrary directories**: with `runs-dir` shared with
  user content, rotation could recursively delete user directories — and its
  own in-flight run. Only uuid-named run records rotate now, never the live
  run, and rotation happens before the new run dir exists.
- **Zero-entry payloads passed silently**: a comment-only `hurl:` block ran
  nothing while the scenario reported green. Load-time lint rejects it;
  the engine backstop emits Skipped outcomes for anything that slips through.
- `proef flows … | head` (and every other command) tolerates a closed pipe;
  a non-UTF-8 environment variable no longer aborts any command.
- Raw `[Options] retry:`/`repeat:` values are parsed and capped (10000), and
  `delay:` is capped at 1 hour in both typed and raw forms; `repeat:` now
  counts toward the batch budget so long repeats aren't blamed on the
  environment.
- Concurrent `proef secret set` calls no longer lose keys (advisory-locked,
  atomic 0600 temp+rename store; the key-creation race resolves to the
  winner's key). `proef fmt` and `schema --add-to` write atomically.
- `proef fmt` keeps fenced body bytes verbatim (blank lines and trailing
  whitespace inside ``` fences are the bytes the test sends).
- Nested suites now load their packs: pack discovery recurses like feature
  discovery (`packs/` directories at any depth); `proef fmt` shares the rule.
- Duplicate/empty Examples header columns are a named error instead of a
  silent last-value-wins; an empty `.feature` gets a plain-language error;
  a UTF-8 BOM is stripped instead of shifting every diagnostic span.

### Changed

- **Then steps are visible everywhere**: `expect:` macros now surface as
  their own step rows in console, events, JUnit, and `explain`, with assert
  failures attributed to the authored `Then` line — the host request no
  longer inherits its followers' assert failures. Artifact bytes are
  unchanged; sidecars gain one row per `Then` (schema-compatible).
- **Error taxonomy**: mistakes in the test's own text (undefined `{{var}}`,
  bad JSONPath/regex/URL/options, unreadable body file) exit 2 instead
  of 3, anchored on hurl's own assert-context flag.
- `when:` guards skip on a literal `false`/`0` as well as empty — an author
  writing `when: ${flag}` with `flag=false` means skip.
- `proef.toml` is no longer gitignored (it is documented, committed project
  config).
- proef-core public API: removed dead surface (`NormalizeReporter`, the
  never-populated `config` resolution tier, `StepOutcome.artifact_span`,
  `LoweredStep.retry`, `StepKeyword`, and friends); added
  `EngineErrorClass::UserInput`, `StepPayload::MergedAsserts`,
  `ScenarioOutcome.artifact_slug`, `Guard::skips`.

## [0.2.1] - 2026-07-29 (review P0 + failure UX)

### Fixed

- `[Options]` header detection follows hurl's token grammar — the injection
  can never land inside XML/JSON/prose bodies (class closed, unit-tested).
- `proef artifacts` survives a closed pipe (exit 0, best-effort writes).
- `--dry-run` honors `--scenario`/`--tags` with the same zero-match exit 2.
- Duplicate scenario names dedup feature-wide (`#N`): unique artifacts,
  console buffers, and events — no silent overwrite.
- `.proef-secrets.json` is created `0600`, gitignored, and documented.

### Changed

- Failure details surface hurl's computed expected/actual (`fixme`) anchored
  on the error's own artifact line, not the entry's first line.
- GETTING-STARTED uses `PROEF_BASE_URL`, points the reader at a runnable
  target, and frames sample output honestly.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-07-29 (correctness, output contract, author docs)

### Fixed (v0.1.0 deep-review follow-up — all three blockers reproduced first)

- `[Options]` injection is body-fence-aware: a `retry:`/`delay:` step whose
  body contains method-looking lines no longer gets options spliced into the
  body it sends.
- Step↔entry correlation is a partition anchored on each entry's request
  line: a comment-only step can no longer cause the next request to be sent
  twice (one authored POST is one POST, asserted via the event stream).
- `delay:` joins the watchdog budget (with saturating duration math
  throughout), so delayed steps are no longer killed as system errors;
  `retry.count` is capped at 10000 by the pack lint.
- A panicking scenario thread is contained (`catch_unwind`), reported as a
  System fault under its real identity immediately — never a budget timeout;
  abandoned scenarios keep their real file/name/line; steps in batches never
  reached report `Skipped` instead of vanishing from every report.

### Changed

- Output contract: `--output json` owns stdout exclusively (human report on
  stderr — pipeable into `jq`); `StepFinished` events carry a `detail`
  failure field (additive); `optional:` failures report `Warned` everywhere
  consistently; engine failure details use hurl's own error descriptions
  instead of Rust `Debug`; diagnostics drop ANSI when stderr is not a
  terminal; a filter selection matching nothing exits 2; failure output
  prints a ready-to-run `reproduce: hurl …` line; the artifact replay header
  names required `--secret` placeholders; the undocumented `.env` autoload
  was removed.

### Added

- Author-facing documentation: `docs/GETTING-STARTED.md` (first suite in ten
  minutes) and `docs/AUTHORING.md` (the full pack/feature reference).
- Mechanical alignment gates: `xtask docs-check` (crates and ADRs must appear
  in their indexes) runs in PR CI; `xtask public-api` snapshots
  `proef-core`'s public API surface (1.4k items) and fails CI on unreviewed
  changes — the mechanical form of the zero-core-diff invariant.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-07-29

Initial release.

### Added

- **Authoring:** Gherkin `.feature` files in plain business prose; YAML macro
  packs bind prose to executable steps via `match:` patterns, typed params,
  defaults, `use:` composition (cycle-checked), `expect:` assert-only macros,
  `optional:`, finite `retry:`, `delay:`, `when:` guards, and `saveAs: global`
  promotions.
- **Validation:** `proef test --dry-run` binds, lowers, emits, and
  parse-validates every scenario without touching the network; stable
  diagnostic codes with source-span rendering; a seeded error corpus pins
  every code; pack payloads are validated at load by the engine that claims
  them.
- **Execution:** the hurl engine runs artifacts in-process (exact-pinned
  `hurl 8.0.1`); contiguous same-engine steps batch maximally; variables and
  cookies chain across batch splits; per-entry `[Options]` override batch
  defaults; finite budgets with a watchdog bound every scenario; Ctrl-C
  cancels gracefully (twice = hard exit); parallel scenarios share a typed
  World with write-set-only merge-back and a persistent global store.
- **Artifacts as the contract:** every scenario emits canonical `.hurl` text
  that is byte-identical to what the engine executes, plus a sidecar map
  (entry ↔ feature anchors, explicit batch/step indices), `.vars`, and any
  referenced file assets — replayable with stock `hurl --test`.
- **Record & reporting:** a versioned JSONL event stream is the run record
  (live per-entry progress included); console BDD tree; JUnit XML; GitHub job
  summaries; `proef explain` replays the record; secrets are encrypted at
  rest, injected via hurl's redaction, and value-redacted once at the event
  sink — never present in artifacts, events, logs, or reports.
- **Tooling:** `proef flows`, `artifacts`, `schema` (merged JSON Schema with
  editor modelines), `secret set|list`, `fmt` (canonical hurl blocks),
  `doctor`, `--watch`; a libtest-mimic harness exposes one test per scenario
  to nextest/IDEs; `${fake:*}` deterministic synthetic data seeded from the
  run id.
- **Quality gates:** unit + property tests, fuzz targets, insta snapshot
  corpus (artifacts, diagnostics, events), fixture-server integration suite,
  assert_cmd CLI/exit-code suite (0/1/2/3 contract), cargo deny/machete/
  zizmor in CI, cargo audit nightly, a scheduled canary against the next
  hurl release, and CI on Linux, macOS, and Windows.
- **Distribution:** tagged releases build five targets (macOS arm64/x86_64,
  Linux arm64/x86_64-gnu, Windows x86_64-msvc) with `cargo auditable`, ship
  a Homebrew tap formula and a `cargo binstall`-compatible layout, and attest
  SLSA provenance once the repository is public.
