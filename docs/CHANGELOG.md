# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.
The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/);
versioning follows [SemVer](https://semver.org) (policy in `docs/RELEASING.md`).

## [Unreleased]

### Documentation

- The stdout/stderr macro rule is now written down where contributors look:
  `docs/CONTRIBUTING.md` ("Rules that are easy to trip over") and `CLAUDE.md`.
  0.5.3 began enforcing it with a source-scanning test, so a raw `println!` or
  `eprintln!` in `proef-cli` failed the suite with nothing explaining the rule
  or naming `render::outln!`/`errln!` as the sanctioned spellings.

## [0.5.3] - 2026-08-06 (closed-pipe safety)

### Fixed

- **The CLI no longer panics when stderr is a closed pipe.** Every remaining
  raw `eprintln!` in `proef-cli` now routes through the EPIPE-safe `errln!`
  guard added in 0.5.2, so `proef test … |& head` ends the pipeline with the
  contracted exit code instead of aborting with 101 — a code outside the typed
  0/1/2/3 taxonomy (ADR-0009). The execution failure summary, which writes
  several lines per failing scenario, was the largest remaining exposure. A
  source-scanning test now keeps raw `eprintln!` out of the crate.
- **The language server no longer dies while recovering from a panic.**
  `proef-lsp` reports a caught analysis panic on stderr; that report used a raw
  `eprintln!`, which panics when its write fails — so a closed stderr (EPIPE)
  took down the very server the surrounding `catch_unwind` exists to keep
  alive. The write is now explicitly unchecked. Ships without a test: reaching
  the line needs a real analysis panic *and* a closed stderr, and the panic is
  not injectable without a test-only hook in shipping code; the mechanism
  itself is already covered by the CLI's closed-pipe tests.

### Changed

- `proef report` derives its output directory through the shared
  `fsutil::parent_dir` helper instead of an open-coded empty-parent fallback,
  so there is one spelling of that derivation. Internal consistency only — the
  emitted artifact links are unchanged.

## [0.5.2] - 2026-08-05 (CLI correctness)

### Fixed

- **A directory-valued `[run] setup`/`teardown` is now a loud user error.**
  ADR-0014 defines setup/teardown as a single feature file; a directory ran
  every feature under it as the phase and again in the pool (a silent
  double-run) — that path is closed.
- Diagnostics no longer panic when stderr is a closed pipe: `print_all` and
  `report_front_error`'s trailing `"{errors} error(s)"` summary line are now
  routed through an EPIPE-safe `errln!` guard (mirroring `outln!`'s stdout
  guard), so `proef test --dry-run <broken suite> |& head` exits cleanly
  instead of panicking (exit 101).
- `diff` step records are now keyed by `(text, occurrence ordinal)` instead of
  text alone — macro-expanded steps that share text no longer collide in the
  last-write-wins map and silently drop out of the diff.
- `diff --fail-on-regression` now fails when the new run is incomplete or
  cancelled (was a silent pass), and banners any incomplete/cancelled record
  in the diff output either way. Its slower-step duration math is hardened
  against overflow (saturating arithmetic).
- **A bare-filename `[run] setup`/`teardown` (or suite path) now resolves its
  packs and assets from the current directory.** A path with no directory
  component (e.g. `setup = "setup.feature"` at the project root) has an empty
  `Path::parent()`, which produced a `cannot read directory` failure; it now
  normalizes to `.` (the current directory) via a shared `fsutil::parent_dir`
  helper at the pack/asset base-derivation sites.

### Documentation

- The second-interrupt hard-exit code **130** (128+SIGINT) is now documented
  for `test` and `watch` (TECH-SPEC §10, ADR-0009) — a deliberate escape
  hatch outside the typed 0/1/2/3 `ExitCode` taxonomy.

## [0.5.1] - 2026-08-05 (LSP go-to-definition + correctness)

### Added

- **LSP go-to-definition: `use:` references and `match:` landing (ADR-0017).**
  Go-to-definition now jumps from a `use:` reference in a pack to the macro it
  targets, and lands on the macro's `match:` line rather than its name key
  (falling back to the name key for use-only macros with no `match:`).

### Fixed

- **LSP: the stdio server now exits cleanly.** `proef lsp` dropped the connection
  after joining the transport threads, so the writer thread (holding the sole
  channel Sender) never ended and the process leaked. It now drops the connection
  before joining. Covered by a real stdio subprocess lifecycle test.
- **LSP: a malformed request no longer crashes the server.** A bad document URI or
  out-of-range position propagated a deserialization error out of the event loop
  and exited the process; the request now gets an `InvalidParams` (-32602) reply
  and the server keeps serving.
- **LSP: one broken pack no longer blanks the whole suite.** `analyze_suite` now
  keeps the packs that loaded (and reports the broken one's diagnostic) instead of
  zeroing all bindings, completion, and go-to-definition on any pack error.
- **LSP: analysis is scoped to the configured suite.** The server roots at
  `[run] suite` (else the `tests/` convention) under its launch directory rather
  than walking the entire working tree, sharing the CLI's suite resolution.
- **LSP: unsaved edits are honored for paths with special characters.** The
  open-buffer overlay is keyed by source name instead of the raw file URI, so a
  path segment containing sub-delimiters (`(`, `+`, `'`, …) no longer misses.

### Documentation

- Documented `proef-lsp` and the `lsp`/`macros`/`diff`/`report` subcommands across
  the README, TECH-SPEC CLI/dependency references, and the RELEASING publish order.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-08-04 (LSP language server)

### Added

- **`proef lsp` language server (ADR-0017).** A server-only, generic-LSP stdio
  binary — a second front-end over the sans-IO core — giving feature/pack authors
  live editor support: **diagnostics** (the whole `--dry-run` validation set,
  republished across the suite as you type), **go-to-definition** (Gherkin step →
  the macro that binds it), **completion** (macro-pattern step completions,
  prefix-ranked by relevance to the typed prose), and **find-references** (every
  step a macro binds). Wired into Neovim/Helix/Emacs via generic LSP config — see
  `docs/EDITORS.md`. No VS Code extension in v1. `proef.toml` config is a startup
  snapshot (restart the server after editing it). Works on Linux, macOS, and
  Windows. Pinned `lsp-server 0.7.9` / `lsp-types 0.97.0`.
- **New `proef-core` public surface** enabling the language server: the injectable
  `SourceProvider` seam (`proef_core::provider`), the collect-all `analyze_suite`
  analysis (`proef_core::analyze`) — the same headless analysis the CLI runs,
  driven over an overlay-then-disk provider so the LSP re-validates the whole suite
  on every edit — and `matcher::prefix_rank` for prose-prefix completion ranking.
  All keep the core sans-IO (the IO is injected).

## [0.4.0] - 2026-08-03 (external config & environments; competitive-review breadth)

### Added

- **Suite setup & teardown (`proef.toml [run] setup`/`teardown`, ADR-0014).**
  Each names a feature run once around the whole suite (the Playwright/Jest
  `globalSetup` model). `setup` runs before the parallel pool and merges its
  `saveAs: global` promotions into the shared store **before any scenario
  lowers**, so it seeds fixtures/shared state every scenario reads via
  `${global:…}`; `teardown` runs once after for cleanup. A setup failure aborts
  the run as a user/system fault (never a test failure, exit 1); teardown runs
  only if setup succeeded and its failure is a distinct exit 3 (never a silently
  green suite). Both are excluded from the pool, so a setup/teardown feature
  inside the suite never also runs as an ordinary scenario.
- **`proef test --output tap`** — a TAP version 13 stream to stdout, one test
  point per scenario, derived from the run's own outcomes (not from hurl), for
  `prove`/`tappy` and TAP-native CI. The human report moves to stderr (as with
  `--output json`). `@quarantine` scenarios map to the `# TODO` directive
  (their failure does not gate); skipped scenarios to `# SKIP`; failure detail
  rides in a redacted YAML block. `--output tap` is rejected on `flows`/`macros`
  (a user error, not a silent human fall-back).
- `proef macros` now flags **near-duplicate** pattern macros — two that differ
  only in their `{capture}` names (identical literal skeleton), which are
  confusable to authors. Advisory only (never gates the exit code); `--output
  json` gains a `nearDuplicateOf` field beside `unused` for a CI hygiene check.
  The heuristic is deliberately tight (skeleton equality), so a legitimately
  similar family with distinct literals is left alone.
- Localized Gherkin (`# language:`) is now verified and test-covered — a
  localized feature parses, its dialect keywords are stripped, and a localized
  scenario outline with `Examples` expands like any other. Outline detection now
  keys primarily on `Examples` presence (dialect-independent) with the English
  keyword as a fallback, so this no longer relies on an English-only heuristic.
  (A localized outline that omits its `Examples` still degrades to an
  unbound-step error, since gherkin 0.16 does not expose its dialect keywords.)
- **Built-in `expect:` shape-macro library.** The embedded `Core` pack gains a
  curated, product-neutral set of response-shape assertions — `the value at
  {path} is a string` / `… a number` / `… a boolean` / `… a uuid` / `… an ISO
  date` / `… present` / `… a non-empty list` — each merging one hurl type
  predicate (`isString`/`isUuid`/`isList` + `count`, …) into the previous
  request. It is a convenience layer over the existing `expect:` mechanism (no
  new engine capability, no marker DSL); the raw-hurl assert vocabulary still
  covers anything the macros don't.
- **Run-level SLA gate (`proef.toml [sla]`).** An opt-in latency budget: after a
  run, per-step wall-clock durations fold into `p95-ms` (95th-percentile ceiling)
  and `max-ms` (slowest-step ceiling); a breach prints the offending metrics + the
  slowest steps and maps to **exit 1** (a test failure). It is off by default (no
  `[sla]` table = no gate, run byte-identical to before), env-overridable via
  `[env.<name>.sla]`, introduces no new exit code, and never downgrades a
  `User`/`System` fault. Distinct from hurl's per-request `duration <` assert —
  the gate is an aggregate budget over the whole run. Skipped steps are excluded
  from the population.

- **External config & environments (`proef.toml`, ADR-0012).** New `[url]` and
  `[vars]` tables hold non-secret suite variables, referenced in packs as
  `${url:<key>}` / `${vars:<key>}`; `[env.<name>.<section>]` profiles deep-merge
  per-environment overrides over the base tables (`url`/`vars`/`http`/`run`).
  `proef test --env <name>` (or `PROEF_ENV`) selects the active environment.
  `proef.toml` is discovered by searching up from the working directory (like
  cargo/git), so it is found from any subdirectory. Adds the
  `proef::resolve::missing_config_var` diagnostic.
- **Default suite path.** `[run] suite` sets the path `proef test`/`flows`/
  `artifacts` use when given none (falling back to the `tests/` convention), so
  `proef test` runs with no argument. An explicit path still wins.
- Documentation set completing the corpus: `docs/DIAGNOSTICS.md` (all 57
  diagnostic codes, corpus coverage marked), `docs/CONFIG.md` (`proef.toml`
  reference), `docs/EVENTS.md` (the `events.jsonl` wire schema for CI),
  `docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md` (exit codes, glyph legend, frequent failures),
  `docs/CONTRIBUTING.md` and `docs/SECURITY.md` (threat model, private
  vulnerability reporting), and an IDE-integration section in AUTHORING.
- `proef test --scenario-file <file>`: scope a `--scenario` name filter to
  one feature file (duplicate scenario names across files stay disjoint;
  the libtest-mimic harness uses it to keep the Trial↔scenario bijection).
- `scenario_finished` events now carry a `file` field — the run-wide scenario
  identity alongside `scenario` (additive, ADR-0008; absent in older records).
- Diagnostics `pack::pattern_duplicate_capture` (a `{capture}` written twice)
  and `lower::kind_unrouted` (internal registry-drift safety net).
- `proef macros` lists every loaded macro with its call count and flags
  user-pack pattern macros that no scenario binds (dead prose bindings);
  `use:`-only helpers and unused builtins are listed but never flagged.
  `--output json` for CI dead-code gates.
- `proef test --run-id <id>` pins the injected run id (like `artifacts --run-id`),
  so a run's `${fake:…}` data — which keys on the run id — is reproducible; the
  JSON summary echoes the id.
- `proef test --dry-run --sarif <path>` serializes validation diagnostics
  (unbound steps, pack lint, non-finite retries) to a SARIF 2.1.0 log — a
  shift-left gate that renders findings as inline PR annotations. The export is
  additive: the dry-run's exit code is unchanged.
- `proef test --rerun` re-runs only the scenarios that failed in the last run
  (read from its JSONL record, keyed on the run-wide `(file, name)` identity);
  it composes with `--tags`/`--scenario`, and reports "nothing to rerun"
  (exit 0) when the prior run was clean.
- `@quarantine` tag: a scenario so tagged runs and reports normally, but its
  *test-failure* no longer gates the exit code (a `System`/`User` fault still
  does — quarantine is for flaky tests, not broken input or infra). A note
  prints when a quarantined scenario fails, so it is never silently swallowed.
- `proef diff [base] [new]` compares two run records (defaulting to the previous
  and latest runs) and reports scenario status transitions — regressed, fixed,
  still-failing, new, removed — keyed on the run-wide `(file, scenario)`
  identity, plus per-step flakiness (rising retry counts) and perf deltas
  (steps diffed on `text`, never the volatile authored line). It is a derived
  view over `events.jsonl`, never a second record (ADR-0008); `--fail-on-regression`
  exits 1 when a scenario regressed, for CI gating.
- Flaky-failure detail: a step that passes only after a retry now records the
  messages from its earlier, failed attempts as `attempt_details` on the
  `step_finished` event (additive, ADR-0008); JUnit surfaces them as
  `<flakyFailure>` under the passing test case, so a green-on-retry run is honest
  instead of indistinguishable from a clean pass. The engine already collected
  the earlier-attempt errors — they were being discarded on success.
- `proef report [run-id]` writes a self-contained HTML report for a run —
  scenario tree with pass/fail pills, per-step attempts and timing, a
  per-scenario timing waterfall (each step's bar offset by the steps before it
  and as wide as its own duration — the sequential cascade within a scenario,
  derived purely from step durations), a **cross-worker timeline** (a lane per
  worker, each scenario a bar on a shared run-relative axis, so concurrency is
  visible at a glance), failure detail, and deep-links to the executed `.hurl`
  artifacts (bodies are not inlined).
- **Injected run timing (ADR-0015).** `scenario_started`/`scenario_finished`
  events gain optional `timestamp_ms` (run-relative) and `worker` (0-based
  index) fields, stamped at the CLI sink on the worker thread so the sans-IO
  core stays clock-free. Additive (absent on records without timing); they power
  the HTML timeline. Records without them degrade to the waterfalls alone. A pure `proef_core::html::render_html` derives it from the event
  stream (ADR-0008, snapshot-locked); the events are already redacted at the
  sink, so the page is too. Defaults to `report.html` inside the run dir; `-o`
  redirects it.

### Changed

- **`--tags` is now a boolean expression, not a comma-separated list.** It takes
  a single expression over `and`/`or`/`not` and parentheses (the `@` stays
  optional), e.g. `--tags "@api and not @slow"`; a bare tag still works. The
  grammar and evaluator live in the sans-IO core (`proef_core::tags`,
  deterministic and fuzzed); a malformed expression is a user error (exit 2), as
  is a selection that matches nothing. This replaces the old CSV OR-list — there
  is one selection mechanism, not two.
- `--output` is a typed value: an unknown format (e.g. a `jsonl` typo) is a
  user error (exit 2) instead of silently degrading to the human report.
- `--watch` reruns only on `.feature`/`.yaml`/`.yml` changes — the watched
  tree can now contain proef's own run output without a self-trigger loop.
- The example corpus (`tests/features/`) and the dev fixture use a neutral
  workspace / activity-board domain (record · note · event · attachment ·
  session · channel) — no product-specific vocabulary.
- `CHANGELOG.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, and `SECURITY.md` moved under `docs/`
  (root keeps only `README.md` and `CLAUDE.md`).
- **Pack root key renamed `templates:` → `macros:`** (ADR-0004 amendment): one
  canonical spelling for the prose→engine binding layer (the entry is a *macro*,
  the file a *pack*). No `templates:` alias — packs using the old key fail to load.
- The dev-loop fixture (`cargo run -p xtask -- fixture`) binds the advertised
  default port **8787** — falling back to an ephemeral port (and printing a
  `PROEF_BASE_URL` line) only if 8787 is busy; `... -- fixture <port>` overrides.
  So `proef.toml`'s default `base` reaches it with no `PROEF_BASE_URL` export
  (ADR-0011 amendment). Its `GET /health` now returns a versioned identity —
  `name`, a numeric `version` (`1.0`), and the RFC 3339 `time` it answered.
- The unbound-step diagnostic (`bind::unbound_step`) now prints a paste-ready
  pack-macro stub — quoted tokens in the sentence become `{argN}` captures —
  alongside the existing did-you-mean suggestion, so an author can add the
  missing macro without hand-writing the `match:`/`hurl:` scaffold.
- CI reporting surfaces failures and flakiness more honestly. Under GitHub
  Actions the run emits a `::error file=,line=,title=` annotation per failure
  (rendered in the PR "Files changed" gutter; gated off when `--output json`
  owns stdout). The job summary gains a **flaky passes** section and per-failure
  attempt counts, and the JUnit report records "passed on attempt N" for a
  scenario that only went green after retries — a silent green-on-attempt-2 is
  no longer invisible.
- `docs/AUTHORING.md` gains an "Asserting responses" cookbook surfacing the hurl
  8.0 predicate/filter/RFC-9535-JSONPath vocabulary that raw `hurl:` blocks
  already accept — documenting existing capability, not new engine work.
- A failed step now prints a `curl:` reproduce line — the redacted `curl` for the
  failing request, surfaced from the embedded engine via a new engine-agnostic
  `StepOutcome.reproduce_hint` — so a failure can be replayed request-by-request
  without leaving the terminal. Secrets are masked.

### Removed

- **The `# key: value` feature-file directive mechanism** (e.g. `# baseURL:`,
  ADR-0012 amendment). Variables now have exactly one home — `proef.toml`
  (`[url]`/`[vars]`) — so a `.feature` file can no longer define a variable
  (one-way-to-do-one-thing). `#` comment lines stay valid gherkin comments; they
  are simply no longer parsed. The env-override the directive provided is
  preserved by embedding `${env:NAME:-default}` in a config value (resolved
  recursively). `${…}` plain-name resolution is now `args > defaults` only.

### Fixed

- Optional-batch error path no longer double-reports later batches into the
  JSONL run record (ADR-0008); `saveAs: global` promotions are no longer
  dropped when the store lock is poisoned; the event sink recovers from a
  poisoned lock instead of truncating the record.
- `expect:` merge scopes to the last entry (fence-aware); `[Options]`
  injection can no longer duplicate a section; the `use:` graph walk is
  node-linear instead of exponential on multi-edge chains.
- The embedded-hurl version lockstep is now asserted by a test; the encrypted
  secret store maps user vs. environment faults to exit 2 vs. 3 (ADR-0009);
  run.log / artifact-write / malformed-`proef.toml` failures surface instead
  of being swallowed.

## [0.3.1] - 2026-07-29 (secret-management hardening)

### Added

- `proef secret rm NAME` removes a stored secret (locked atomic rewrite;
  removing an absent name exits 2).
- `PROEF_KEY` env override supplies the project key directly (base64) — a
  committed ciphertext store now decrypts in CI without shipping the key
  file; a set-but-invalid key errors instead of silently falling through.
- `proef doctor` reports secret store/key health (readable, parseable,
  private permissions); a corrupt `.proef-secrets.json` no longer bricks
  `secret set` — it is moved aside to `.corrupt` and a fresh store begins.

### Fixed

- **Secret-valued captures never reach `.proef-state.json`**: a
  `saveAs: global` capture whose value equals a known secret is refused —
  the owning step warns with the reason — closing the one sink the
  redaction invariant (ADR-0005) did not cover.
- Secret resolution reads the store and key once per run instead of once
  per secret (no torn view against a concurrent `secret set`).
- Warned steps now print their reason on the console (`↳ …`) — a bare ⚠
  glyph explained nothing, for `optional:` failures too.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-07-29 (data-safety blockers, Then visibility, taxonomy)

### Fixed (v0.2.1 review — every finding reproduced before fixing)

- **Asset copy destroyed user files**: `proef artifacts -o` pointing at the
  suite truncated referenced assets to 0 bytes, and `..` references escaped
  the output directory. Copies now refuse absolute/`..` references (exit 2),
  never copy a file onto itself, and surface IO errors (exit 3).
- **Run rotation deleted arbitrary directories**: with `runs-dir` shared with
  user content, rotation could recursively delete user directories — and its
  own in-flight run. Only uuid-named run records rotate now, never the live
  run, and rotation happens before the new run dir exists.
- **Zero-entry payloads passed silently**: a comment-only `hurl:` block ran
  nothing while the scenario reported green. Load-time lint rejects it;
  the engine backstop emits Skipped outcomes for anything that slips through.
- `proef flows … | head` (and every other command) tolerates a closed pipe;
  a non-UTF-8 environment variable no longer aborts any command.
- Raw `[Options] retry:`/`repeat:` values are parsed and capped (10000), and
  `delay:` is capped at 1 hour in both typed and raw forms; `repeat:` now
  counts toward the batch budget so long repeats aren't blamed on the
  environment.
- Concurrent `proef secret set` calls no longer lose keys (advisory-locked,
  atomic 0600 temp+rename store; the key-creation race resolves to the
  winner's key). `proef fmt` and `schema --add-to` write atomically.
- `proef fmt` keeps fenced body bytes verbatim (blank lines and trailing
  whitespace inside ``` fences are the bytes the test sends).
- Nested suites now load their packs: pack discovery recurses like feature
  discovery (`packs/` directories at any depth); `proef fmt` shares the rule.
- Duplicate/empty Examples header columns are a named error instead of a
  silent last-value-wins; an empty `.feature` gets a plain-language error;
  a UTF-8 BOM is stripped instead of shifting every diagnostic span.

### Changed

- **Then steps are visible everywhere**: `expect:` macros now surface as
  their own step rows in console, events, JUnit, and `explain`, with assert
  failures attributed to the authored `Then` line — the host request no
  longer inherits its followers' assert failures. Artifact bytes are
  unchanged; sidecars gain one row per `Then` (schema-compatible).
- **Error taxonomy**: mistakes in the test's own text (undefined `{{var}}`,
  bad JSONPath/regex/URL/options, unreadable body file) exit 2 instead
  of 3, anchored on hurl's own assert-context flag.
- `when:` guards skip on a literal `false`/`0` as well as empty — an author
  writing `when: ${flag}` with `flag=false` means skip.
- `proef.toml` is no longer gitignored (it is documented, committed project
  config).
- proef-core public API: removed dead surface (`NormalizeReporter`, the
  never-populated `config` resolution tier, `StepOutcome.artifact_span`,
  `LoweredStep.retry`, `StepKeyword`, and friends); added
  `EngineErrorClass::UserInput`, `StepPayload::MergedAsserts`,
  `ScenarioOutcome.artifact_slug`, `Guard::skips`.

## [0.2.1] - 2026-07-29 (review P0 + failure UX)

### Fixed

- `[Options]` header detection follows hurl's token grammar — the injection
  can never land inside XML/JSON/prose bodies (class closed, unit-tested).
- `proef artifacts` survives a closed pipe (exit 0, best-effort writes).
- `--dry-run` honors `--scenario`/`--tags` with the same zero-match exit 2.
- Duplicate scenario names dedup feature-wide (`#N`): unique artifacts,
  console buffers, and events — no silent overwrite.
- `.proef-secrets.json` is created `0600`, gitignored, and documented.

### Changed

- Failure details surface hurl's computed expected/actual (`fixme`) anchored
  on the error's own artifact line, not the entry's first line.
- GETTING-STARTED uses `PROEF_BASE_URL`, points the reader at a runnable
  target, and frames sample output honestly.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-07-29 (correctness, output contract, author docs)

### Fixed (v0.1.0 deep-review follow-up — all three blockers reproduced first)

- `[Options]` injection is body-fence-aware: a `retry:`/`delay:` step whose
  body contains method-looking lines no longer gets options spliced into the
  body it sends.
- Step↔entry correlation is a partition anchored on each entry's request
  line: a comment-only step can no longer cause the next request to be sent
  twice (one authored POST is one POST, asserted via the event stream).
- `delay:` joins the watchdog budget (with saturating duration math
  throughout), so delayed steps are no longer killed as system errors;
  `retry.count` is capped at 10000 by the pack lint.
- A panicking scenario thread is contained (`catch_unwind`), reported as a
  System fault under its real identity immediately — never a budget timeout;
  abandoned scenarios keep their real file/name/line; steps in batches never
  reached report `Skipped` instead of vanishing from every report.

### Changed

- Output contract: `--output json` owns stdout exclusively (human report on
  stderr — pipeable into `jq`); `StepFinished` events carry a `detail`
  failure field (additive); `optional:` failures report `Warned` everywhere
  consistently; engine failure details use hurl's own error descriptions
  instead of Rust `Debug`; diagnostics drop ANSI when stderr is not a
  terminal; a filter selection matching nothing exits 2; failure output
  prints a ready-to-run `reproduce: hurl …` line; the artifact replay header
  names required `--secret` placeholders; the undocumented `.env` autoload
  was removed.

### Added

- Author-facing documentation: `docs/GETTING-STARTED.md` (first suite in ten
  minutes) and `docs/AUTHORING.md` (the full pack/feature reference).
- Mechanical alignment gates: `xtask docs-check` (crates and ADRs must appear
  in their indexes) runs in PR CI; `xtask public-api` snapshots
  `proef-core`'s public API surface (1.4k items) and fails CI on unreviewed
  changes — the mechanical form of the zero-core-diff invariant.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-07-29

Initial release.

### Added

- **Authoring:** Gherkin `.feature` files in plain business prose; YAML macro
  packs bind prose to executable steps via `match:` patterns, typed params,
  defaults, `use:` composition (cycle-checked), `expect:` assert-only macros,
  `optional:`, finite `retry:`, `delay:`, `when:` guards, and `saveAs: global`
  promotions.
- **Validation:** `proef test --dry-run` binds, lowers, emits, and
  parse-validates every scenario without touching the network; stable
  diagnostic codes with source-span rendering; a seeded error corpus pins
  every code; pack payloads are validated at load by the engine that claims
  them.
- **Execution:** the hurl engine runs artifacts in-process (exact-pinned
  `hurl 8.0.1`); contiguous same-engine steps batch maximally; variables and
  cookies chain across batch splits; per-entry `[Options]` override batch
  defaults; finite budgets with a watchdog bound every scenario; Ctrl-C
  cancels gracefully (twice = hard exit); parallel scenarios share a typed
  World with write-set-only merge-back and a persistent global store.
- **Artifacts as the contract:** every scenario emits canonical `.hurl` text
  that is byte-identical to what the engine executes, plus a sidecar map
  (entry ↔ feature anchors, explicit batch/step indices), `.vars`, and any
  referenced file assets — replayable with stock `hurl --test`.
- **Record & reporting:** a versioned JSONL event stream is the run record
  (live per-entry progress included); console BDD tree; JUnit XML; GitHub job
  summaries; `proef explain` replays the record; secrets are encrypted at
  rest, injected via hurl's redaction, and value-redacted once at the event
  sink — never present in artifacts, events, logs, or reports.
- **Tooling:** `proef flows`, `artifacts`, `schema` (merged JSON Schema with
  editor modelines), `secret set|list`, `fmt` (canonical hurl blocks),
  `doctor`, `--watch`; a libtest-mimic harness exposes one test per scenario
  to nextest/IDEs; `${fake:*}` deterministic synthetic data seeded from the
  run id.
- **Quality gates:** unit + property tests, fuzz targets, insta snapshot
  corpus (artifacts, diagnostics, events), fixture-server integration suite,
  assert_cmd CLI/exit-code suite (0/1/2/3 contract), cargo deny/machete/
  zizmor in CI, cargo audit nightly, a scheduled canary against the next
  hurl release, and CI on Linux, macOS, and Windows.
- **Distribution:** tagged releases build five targets (macOS arm64/x86_64,
  Linux arm64/x86_64-gnu, Windows x86_64-msvc) with `cargo auditable`, ship
  a Homebrew tap formula and a `cargo binstall`-compatible layout, and attest
  SLSA provenance once the repository is public.
